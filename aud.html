        <div class="div4">  &emsp; This project is to make an audio recording. When I didn't have any ideas, the noise of the next door neighbor gave me inspiration. I began to wonder if I could record the daily noise of my neighbors, after considering that my neighbors might be a little cranky. A hasty recording of his voice could be detrimental to my safety. I chose to forgo a theme called "Recording the Loud voices of Neighbors." I changed my theme to "The dormitory where I live is next to a large farm". I looked for the sounds of dogs, pigs, cows, ducks and rubber ducks as materials. I extracted the loud parts of these sounds by mixing them, cutting them, reducing the noise, tuning them, making echoes, changing the tempo, and keeping only the low frequencies. At the same time, I also recorded some of my own sounds, such as tapping on the keyboard, opening and closing doors. </div>
