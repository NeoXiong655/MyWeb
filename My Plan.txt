I will design a personal website and aim to showcase my skills and designs through this website. My audience is mainly interviewers, and the main content of this website will be some of my works. I want to show the projects I completed in my school class. There are also many projects I have done outside of class. I'll look at the personal websites of other job seekers on the Internet and see what information they include. I will also look for exciting website designs that impress the interviewer. I'm also considering using more JavaScript features to make my website more functional. But the main thing is to think about how to express my creativity and strengths.
In selecting project content, I will choose several projects that I have done more outstandingly and that better reflect my strengths. Fortunately, many projects I've worked on have been documented on video, so I can show these videos on my website. On the other hand, I'm also exploring more web design features, such as accessibility and canvas scripting. I hope to master some of the interactive features and display them on my website. My ultimate goal is to make a website, not just a web page. I want a nice UI and load animations when jumping to web pages. I hope this project is challenging for me.
